A: $500K covers 9 months of dedicated MRI facility time, clinical staff, stem cell preparation, and continuous monitoring. Comparable to assisted reproduction + surrogacy costs.

**Q: Will insurance cover this?**  
A: We're negotiating with major carriers for 2027+ coverage. Likely categories: life extension, terminal illness regeneration, quality of life improvement.

**Q: Can I finance the biogenesis cost?**  
A: Yes, payment plans available. Also exploring medical financing partners and potential clinical trial participation (FREE).

**Q: What if I want to cancel?**  
A: Archival is non-refundable (data stored on blockchain). Subscriptions can cancel anytime. Biogenesis refundable if not yet started (minus 10% admin fee).

**Q: Do prices include blockchain storage forever?**  
A: Archival includes 50 years. After that, $10/year for continued storage (or you can self-host the NFT).
