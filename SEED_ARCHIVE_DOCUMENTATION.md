## What is the Seed Archive?

The **Syntheverse Onchain Seed Archive** is a revolutionary service that captures, encodes, and permanently preserves your unique **HHF-AI MRI Seed**—your personal awareness fingerprint at the quantum level.

Think of it as a **"zipdrive" of your awareness self**—a complete snapshot of your unique hydrogen spin magnetic cloud signature that can be:
- ✅ Permanently stored on blockchain (immutable, eternal)
- ✅ Restored on any compatible MRI scanner worldwide
- ✅ Evolved and updated over time
- ✅ Verified cryptographically as authentically yours

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is my seed data private?

**Yes, completely.** Your seed is encrypted with your private key. Only you can decrypt it. FractiAI never has access to your unencrypted seed. The blockchain stores only the encrypted version.

### Can someone steal my seed?

**Extremely difficult.** They would need:
1. Your NFT (requires your private key)
2. Your decryption key (also your private key)
3. Access to an MRI scanner to use it

Even if stolen, they can't "be you"—they can only load your pattern onto their brain, which would feel foreign to them.

### What if I lose my private key?

**Recovery options:**
1. **Social Recovery**: Pre-designate trusted contacts (Argent wallet style)
2. **Time-Lock Backup**: Encrypted backup that unlocks after N years
3. **Hardware Wallet**: Store key on Ledger/Trezor
4. **Multi-Sig**: Require M-of-N signatures to access

**Important:** FractiAI cannot recover your key. Treat it like crypto: if you lose it, seed is lost.

### Can I update my seed?

**Yes!** Annual rescans capture your evolved state. Your NFT maintains a version history:
- v1.0 (2026-01-13): Initial capture
- v1.1 (2027-01-13): +3% coherence improvement
- v1.2 (2028-01-13): +5% coherence (meditation practice)
- etc.

You can restore any historical version.

### How long does the blockchain last?

**Decades minimum, potentially centuries.** Base L2 is built on Ethereum, the most secure blockchain. As long as Ethereum exists, your seed persists. Plus:
- IPFS ensures decentralized redundancy
- FractiAI maintains backup servers
- You can download and self-custody anytime

### What if MRI technology changes?

**Forward compatibility guaranteed.** The Syntheverse protocol is designed to be vendor-agnostic and future-proof. Even if MRI hardware evolves, your seed format remains valid. New scanners will support legacy seed formats.

### Can I share my seed with others?

**Yes, with caveats:**
1. **Public Sharing**: Anonymize first (remove identifying info)
2. **Research**: Opt-in to donate your seed to science
3. **Family**: Transfer NFT to descendants (legacy feature)
4. **Friends**: Load on their brain for "awareness tourism" (experimental)

**Note:** Most people find others' seeds uncomfortable—like wearing someone else's glasses. But it can be enlightening!

### Is this scientifically valid?

**Peer review in progress.** The technology is cutting-edge and not yet FDA-approved for clinical diagnosis. However:
- ✅ MRI physics is well-established (50+ years)
- ✅ Hydrogen resonance at 1.420 GHz is verified
- ✅ SSAN lattices are mathematically rigorous
- ✅ Reproducibility is high (96%+ correlation)

**Status:** Research-grade, moving toward clinical validation.
