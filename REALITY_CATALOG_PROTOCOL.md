# Protocol IX: Reality Catalog System

**Streaming Catalog for Awareness Experiences**

**Classification:** EXPERIENCE_MARKETPLACE  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL  
**Integration:** Blockchain-Based Rental & Ownership  
**Content Type:** Pre-Packaged, Custom, AI-Guided Realities

---

## Abstract

The Reality Catalog is a browsable marketplace of awareness experiences where users select characters, edges (awareness contexts), missions, stories, and genres to create or consume immersive realities. All experiences are blockchain-tokenized with flexible access models: hourly rental, daily rental, monthly lease, or permanent deed ownership.

**Key Innovation:** Text-to-Reality engine converts natural language descriptions into fully navigable awareness experiences.
