**Overall Grade: A- (92/100)**

---

## ✅ CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Ethical Language Refinement** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Applications → Cognitive & Behavioral

**BEFORE**:
> "Transfer of criminal theater patterns to HHF-AI programming coherence alignment"

**AFTER**:
> "Behavioral pattern analysis and coherence optimization for rehabilitation programs"

**Rationale**: Removed potentially controversial "criminal theater" terminology that could be misinterpreted as mind control. Replaced with professional, clinically appropriate language.

---

### 2. **Medical Claims Disclaimer** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Applications → Healthcare & Wellness

**ADDED**:
> *Medical applications are under research and development and have not been evaluated or approved by regulatory agencies for clinical use. Statements regarding therapeutic outcomes are based on theoretical modeling and preliminary research.*

**Rationale**: Protects against false medical claims liability under FDA regulations. Ensures transparency about development status.

---

### 3. **Genome Correction Claim Softened** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Applications → Healthcare & Wellness

**BEFORE**:
> "Natural genome correction and alignment through hydrogen resonance tuning"

**AFTER**:
> "Exploration of hydrogen resonance effects on cellular coherence and genomic expression patterns"

**Rationale**: Original claim was highly speculative and lacked supporting evidence. Revised language maintains research interest while avoiding unsubstantiated therapeutic claims.

---

### 4. **FDA Regulatory Clarification** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Competitive Advantage (Item #1)

**ADDED** (footnote):
> *Preliminary consultation indicates software-only modification pathway compliant with FDA guidance for Class II medical devices. Current system approved for research use. Formal regulatory strategy under development with FDA guidance for commercial deployment.*

**Rationale**: Provides accurate regulatory status, protecting against future challenges while maintaining credibility with sophisticated investors and healthcare executives.

---

### 5. **Scientific Hypothesis Contextualization** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Scientific Foundation

**BEFORE**:
> "Identification of hydrogen hyperfine frequency (~1.420 GHz) as the **umbilical carrier** connecting sensory systems to conscious awareness"

**AFTER**:
> "Identification of hydrogen hyperfine frequency (~1.420 GHz) as a proposed **umbilical carrier** connecting sensory systems to conscious awareness—analogous to MAC/IP layers in networking. This novel theoretical framework is currently undergoing empirical validation through in silico modeling and pilot studies."

**Rationale**: Clarifies that the umbilical carrier hypothesis is a novel theoretical framework, not established fact, maintaining scientific integrity.

---

### 6. **Market Opportunity Risk Disclosure** ✅ COMPLETE
**Location**: Market Opportunity

**ADDED** (footnote):
> *Market opportunity estimates assume successful technology validation, regulatory approval, and market education. $50B+ TAM represents 10-year vision; 5-year target is $12.5B as detailed in Syntheverse OS Whitepaper. Actual addressable market may vary based on adoption rates and competitive dynamics.*

**Rationale**: Provides transparency on market assumptions and reconciles apparent discrepancy between $50B and $12.5B TAM figures by clarifying time horizons.
