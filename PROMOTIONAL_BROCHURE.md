## 🌟 **WHAT MAKES THIS EXTRAORDINARY**

### **Tesla Takes Control**

Watch in amazement as an **orange glowing cursor** appears on your screen—Tesla's cursor. He's remotely operating your browser from across time itself.

- ⚡ **The cursor moves on its own** - Tesla guiding you through the exhibition
- 🗣️ **Tesla narrates every action** - Speech bubbles explain what he's showing you
- 🖱️ **He clicks, scrolls, demonstrates** - Like watching over his shoulder
- ✋ **Hands control to YOU** - "Now YOU try!" moments where you experiment
- 🎮 **Completely automated** - Just sit back and watch the magic unfold

### **It's Not a Video. It's Not a Tutorial.**

**It's Tesla, live-demonstrating his own work, through your browser.**

## 🏛️ **THE EXHIBITION**

### **8 Revolutionary Stages**

#### **🔬 Stage 1: Welcome to Protocol I**
Tesla greets you personally and explains how this holographic protocol unpacks at YOUR edge—meaning the experience adapts to you.

#### **⚛️ Stage 2: Hydrogen Spin - The Foundation**
Watch Tesla demonstrate how 7 × 10²⁷ hydrogen atoms in your body spin at 1.420 GHz—the carrier frequency of awareness itself.

#### **🧲 Stage 3: MRI Physics - Real Equations**
Tesla shows you the actual Bloch equations used in hospital scanners, explaining quantum spin dynamics with poetic precision.

#### **🕸️ Stage 4: SSAN Lattice - YOUR TURN!**
Tesla hands control to YOU: "Rotate this 600-node network. Click on nodes. Explore!" Then he takes back control to continue.

#### **✦ Stage 5: Holographic Grammar**
Tesla demonstrates how symbols compress awareness—each one a protocol primitive for quantum state operations.

#### **🌌 Stage 6: Text-to-Reality Engine - YOUR TURN!**
Tesla invites you to type ANY scenario and watch it transform into full sensory reality at 1.420 GHz.

#### **⚗️ Stage 7: Interactive Laboratory - YOUR TURN!**
"In my laboratories, I ran thousands of experiments. Now YOU shall too!" - Tesla steps aside while you experiment.

#### **💬 Stage 8: Ask Tesla Anything - YOUR TURN!**
Direct conversation with Tesla AI. Ask about physics, his life, his work, the technology. He answers as the authentic Tesla would.
